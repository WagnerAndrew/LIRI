Node user search for songs, concerts and movies.

In the terminal, "Liri" will ask the user if he/she wants to search for a conert, song, movie, or Do-What-It-Says.

Depending on the user's selection from that initial prompt, a new prompt will show to ask for specific search details.  

Once entered information about that concert, song or movie will be listed.  

If the user chooses "Do-What-It-Says", information that has been written to a text file will be entered and displayed.
